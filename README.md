# Tile Matching Game - ReactJS Project

Welcome to the Tile Matching Game project! This project is a fun and interactive game built using ReactJS where players can test their memory and matching skills. Inspired by classic tile-matching games like "Mahjong," this project offers an engaging gaming experience for users of all ages.

## Project Overview

The Tile Matching Game project allows users to:

- Enter their name to personalize the gaming experience.
- Play the game by matching pairs of tiles on the game board.
- Keep track of their score by matching tiles correctly and penalizing incorrect matches.
- Monitor their progress with a timer that tracks the time spent solving the board.
- View a success screen upon completing the game, displaying their final score and time taken.

## How to Play

1. **Enter Your Name:** Before starting the game, users are prompted to enter their name. This adds a personalized touch to the gaming experience and allows for storage in the browser's local storage for future visits.

2. **Play the Game:** Once the user submits their name, they can start playing the game. The game board consists of a grid of tiles that the user can click on to reveal hidden emojis.

3. **Match Tiles:** The objective of the game is to match pairs of identical tiles by clicking on them. When two matching tiles are revealed, they remain open, and the user earns points. However, if the tiles do not match, they are flipped back over, and the user incurs a penalty.

4. **Keep Score:** The game keeps track of the user's score, awarding points for each successful match and deducting points for each failed attempt.

5. **Watch the Clock:** As the user plays, a timer tracks the time spent solving the entire board. This adds a competitive element to the game as users aim to complete the board as quickly as possible.

6. **Finish Up:** Upon successfully matching all the tiles on the board, the user is greeted with a success screen. Here, they can view their final score and the time taken to complete the game.

## Technologies Used
